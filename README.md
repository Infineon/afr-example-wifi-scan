## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox® software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.1
- Programming Language: C
- [ModusToolbox FreeRTOS SDK](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos)
- [Cypress Programmer](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/cypress-programmer-archive)
- Associated Parts: All [PSoC® 6 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/PSoC6) parts with Amazon FreeRTOS support

## Supported Toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm® Embedded Compiler v7.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm compiler v6.11 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ compiler v8.42.2 (`IAR`)

## Supported Kits

- [PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) (`CY8CPROTO-062-4343W`) - Default target
- [PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT) (`CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT`)
- [PSoC 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012) (`CY8CKIT-062S2-43012`)


## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

### First Steps:

1. Clone Amazon FreeRTOS from [GitHub](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos/releases) and checkout the latest release using its tag. Following command also clones all the submodules.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos.git -b 202007-MTBAFR2041 --recurse-submodules
   ```
   
2. Go to *\<amazon-freertos>/projects/cypress* folder. 

   **Note:** *\<amazon-freertos>* refers to the path of the Amazon FreeRTOS folder in your computer. 

3. Clone or download this code example, or copy it if you already have it.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/afr-example-wifi-scan.git
   ```

4. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

### Using ModusToolbox IDE:

1. Go to **File > Import**.
2. Choose **Existing Projects into Workspace** under **General** and click **Next**. 
3. Click the **Browse** button near **Select root directory**, choose the CE folder *\<amazon-freertos>/projects/cypress/afr-example-wifi-scan*, and click **Finish**. 
4. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.
5. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **afr-example-wifi-scan Program (KitProg3)**.

To program a target board different from the default one defined using the TARGET variable in the Makefile, you need to generate the launch configurations for the new target. See [Running Amazon FreeRTOS Code Examples - KBA228845](https://www.cypress.com/KBA228845) for details.

### Using Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the CE folder. 

2. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:

   ```
   make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
   ```
   Example:

   ```
   make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
   ```

### Using CMake:

1. Create a build folder (e.g., *cmake_build*) under *\<amazon-freertos>/build*.

2. Run the following command from the build folder:

   ```
   cmake -G Ninja -S ../.. -B . -DVENDOR=cypress -DCOMPILER=arm-gcc -DBOARD=CY8CPROTO_062_4343W -DAPP=projects/cypress/afr-example-wifi-scan
   ```


3. Once CMake has generated the configuration, run the following command:

   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Use [Cypress Programmer](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-programming-solutions) to program the *afr-example-wifi-scan.elf* file generated under *\<amazon-freertos>/build/cmake_build*.

## Operation

After programming, the application starts automatically. [Figure 1](#figure-1-serial-terminal-output.png) shows the serial terminal output. Note that the SSIDs have been renamed purposefully.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the ModusToolbox IDE, use the **afr-example-wifi-scan Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. See [Debugging a PSoC 6 MCU ModusToolbox Project - KBA224621](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15763) for details.

## Design and Implementation

This example sets up a task to perform periodic scan of Wi-Fi APs. Once the FreeRTOS scheduler has started, the task starts running. It first turns the Wi-Fi interface ON, then scans, and prints the details of the APs to the UART terminal. This example directly sets up the task without using the Demo Runner. 

### Resources and Settings

The following ModusToolbox resources are used in this example.
